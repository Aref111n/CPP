/*
A graph is said to be regular or K-regular if all its vertices have the same degree K. A graph whose all vertices have degree 2 is known as a 2-regular graph.

- A regular graph can be disconnected

Given necessary info about a graph with n vertex and m edges, find if the graph is a k-regular graph. Also print the value of k.
